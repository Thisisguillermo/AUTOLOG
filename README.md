Warning: This isn't my standard format of README.md, notes or anything else. Judge the project itself, not the readme.me since I'm aware of the bad format.
English and Dunglish (Dutch English) is entirely for me and some people. Everthing that is said, doesn't mean it's going to be implented in this project.
